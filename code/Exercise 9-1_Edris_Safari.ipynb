    "As sample size increases, the power of a hypothesis test increases, which means it is more likely to be positive if the effect is real. Conversely, as sample size decreases, the test is less likely to be positive even if the effect is real.\n",
    "To investigate this behavior, run the tests in this chapter with different subsets of the NSFG data. You can use thinkstats2.SampleRows to select a random subset of the rows in a DataFrame. What happens to the p-values of these tests as the sample size decreases? What is the smallest sample size that yields a positive test?"
